# Fruit Detection Using YOLOv8

## Overview

This project leverages YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) to detect fruits in images. It includes a frontend application, `app.py`, which allows users to upload images and view the detection results interactively.

## Features

- **Fruit Detection**: Identifies and classifies fruits in images using YOLOv8.
- **Interactive Frontend**: The `app.py` file provides a user-friendly interface to display detection results.
- **Dataset**: Contains images and annotations for model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ensure all required Python packages are installed (see `requirements.txt` for a list).

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Fruit-Detection-Using-YOLOv8.git
   cd Fruit-Detection-Using-YOLOv8
Prepare the Dataset

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.

Run the Application

Start the application by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will launch the web application, allowing you to upload images and view the results of fruit detection.

**View Detected Images**

The frontend will display both the original image and the detected image with fruits highlighted by bounding boxes.
